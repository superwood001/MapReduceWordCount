Here are the problems you will solve:

(a) Write a MapReduce program to count all the words in the input file and outputs the 100 most frequent words.

(b) Modify your program to use a combiner and compare performance (time in seconds) against your first implementation. You should use the same AWS configuration and number of nodes you used in a)

(c) Add to your code a method that uses MapReduce to count the number of words with a given length. The output should contain the 100 most frequent words in decreasing order of frequency. For example: words with 2, 3, 4, â€¦ letters.
